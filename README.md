# Barcode Detection and Decoding System

This project presents two different implementations for **barcode detection and decoding from images** using image processing techniques.

The project is implemented **twice**:
- One version using external libraries
- One version implemented from scratch using pure Python

This comparison demonstrates both **practical efficiency** and **algorithmic understanding**.

## 📂 Project Versions

### 1️⃣ With Libraries
An implementation that utilizes powerful computer vision libraries to efficiently detect and decode barcodes.

📁 Folder: `with-libraries/`

**Key Libraries:**
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pyzbar
- Matplotlib

---

### 2️⃣ Without Libraries (Pure Python)
A low-level implementation developed without relying on external computer vision libraries, focusing on core image processing concepts.

📁 Folder: `without-libraries/`

**Key Features:**
- Manual image processing
- No barcode decoding libraries
- Educational and algorithm-focused approach

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Automate barcode detection and extraction from images  
- Understand image processing techniques at both high and low levels  
- Compare performance and complexity between library-based and pure Python implementations  

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Grayscale Conversion  
- Noise Reduction (Gaussian / Median Filtering)  
- Thresholding
