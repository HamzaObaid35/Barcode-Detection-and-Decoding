# Barcode Detection and Decoding Using Pure Python

This version of the project demonstrates barcode detection using **pure Python image processing techniques** without relying on specialized barcode libraries.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- Convert image to grayscale  
- Apply median filtering for noise reduction  
- Apply thresholding  
- Detect barcode regions using projections and pixel analysis  
- Extract barcode region manually  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- PIL (Pillow)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ✅ Advantages

- Deep understanding of image processing fundamentals  
- No dependency on barcode libraries  
- Educational and low-level implementation  

---

## ⚠ Limitations

- Slower than library-based approach  
- Sensitive to noise and image quality  
- Does not fully decode barcode values  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add advanced filtering techniques  
- Improve robustness under varying lighting  
- Implement feature-based detection methods
